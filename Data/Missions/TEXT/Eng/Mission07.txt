#M07D01S01    [Warlord][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t01.ogg]Now, when the supplies are delivered, you need to begin to build the camp.
#M07D01S02    [Elhant][Angry][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t02.ogg]I am a warrior, not a builder! It's important to find out what has happened on the road to the city of Ringing Water.
#M07D01S03P1    [Warlord][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t03.ogg]We shall wait for the druids' help. I order you to organize the defence of the camp.

#M07D01S03P2    [Elhant][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t04.ogg]But we have to attack, not defend ourselves and draw back.
#M07D01S03P3    [Elhant][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t05.ogg]I'll carry out your order, Chief - but only because you're wounded and can't lead the defense yourself.

#M07D01S04   [Warlord][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t06.ogg]Ranger... Remember, the next time you disobey, I'll expel you from the army forever.
#M07D01S05P1    [Lana][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t07.ogg]I've talked to the druid Draelnor. The magic portals have stopped working, and now the sage is trying to restore them.
#M07D01S05P2    [Lana][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t08.ogg]When the portals start working, he will teleport our whole army to the city.



#M07D02S01    [M7Centaur2][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t09.ogg]Do you command the defense? Then we have important news for you!
#M07D02S02    [Elhant][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t10.ogg]I'm listening, warrior.
#M07D02S03P1    [M7Centaur2][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t11.ogg]We have noticed several dark sorcerers who were stealing through to the elfish graveyard.
#M07D02S03P2    [M7Centaur2][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t12.ogg]I know not why, but they must be up to no good.
#M07D02S04    [Lana][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t13.ogg]Why haven't you stopped them yourselves?
#M07D02S04P02    [M7Centaur2][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t14.ogg]You see - there are very few of us!
#M07D02S05    [Lana][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t15.ogg]I'll take the soldiers and go to the woods...
#M07D02S06   [Elhant][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t16.ogg]No. You'll stay here and command the defense of the camp.
#M07D02S06P02    [Elhant][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t17.ogg]I want to know what those sorcerers intend to do and why they need to defile the graves of our people.
#M07D02S07    [Lana][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t18.ogg]You don't have the right to give me orders! 
#M07D02S07P02    [Lana][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t19.ogg]Only my father may decide who will stay in the camp and who will go scouting.
#M07D02S08    [Elhant][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t20.ogg]Your father is wounded. He doesn't understand what's happening.
#M07D02S08P01    [Elhant][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t21.ogg]Don't argue, I've already decided! I will have a small troop with me... and these scouts.




#M07D03S01    [Elhant][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t25.ogg]Are you the one Lana spoke about?
#M07D03S02    [Draelnor][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t26.ogg]The druids have asked me to help you. I'm Draelnor.
#M07D03S03P1    [Elhant][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t27.ogg]At last! Will you open the portals to teleport the army to World Mountain?
#M07D03S04P1    [Draelnor][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t28.ogg]I cannot. The magic of portals needs time to heal. Let me help you another way.
#M07D03S04P2    [Draelnor][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t29.ogg]Here, these are enchanted seeds; we shall sow them on the nearest field. 

#M07D03S05    [Draelnor][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t30.ogg]They will grow into mighty warriors even before the sun gets halfway across the sky.
#M07D03S06   [Elhant][Suprised][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t31.ogg]I once knew one of that kind... his name was Old Ash. Well, old man, start sowing!

#M07D03S06P02    [Draelnor][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t32.ogg]Not so fast, Ranger. The field has to be protected, the shoots of treefolk can very easily be destroyed. 
#M07D03S06P03    [Draelnor][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t33.ogg]The undead will sense them and attack for sure.





#M07D07S01   [Draelnor][][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t34.ogg]The treefolk are ready for battle, young Ranger. You can send them to fight.



#M07D04S01    [M7Centaur1][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t36.ogg]The huge army of undead approaches from the east. There are necromancers and liches among them.
#M07D04S02    [Elhant][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t37.ogg]We must fight on.
#M07D04S03    [M7Centaur1][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t38.ogg]We don't have enough powers and your troops are tired from the long battles. You will be crushed. 
#M07D04S04    [Elhant][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t39.ogg]Old man, do the portals work?
#M07D04S05    [Draelnor][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t40.ogg]I have unwound the threads of the dark spell, but in order to make the portals function properly time is required. We will have to wait a while longer.


#M07D05S01    [Draelnor][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t41.ogg]Warriors, listen! The portals are not working perfectly, but I will try to send you straight to World Mountain.




#M07D10S01P01     [Elhant][Angry][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t22.ogg]Necromances are turning the fallen warriors into the undead!
#M07D10S01P02   [Elhant][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t23.ogg]All the elves who have died in battle become their soldiers.
#M07D10S02P01    [Elhant][Angry][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t24.ogg]How can these enemies be defeated? Our deaths only strengthen their army!
#M07D10S03P01    [Elhant][Suprised][Missions\SOUND\MISSION07\m07_t35.ogg]These treefolk are the mighty warriors. Each of them has fought a whole detachment of the enemies forces.
