#M12D01S03    [Elhant][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION12\m12_t19.ogg]The enemy has struck at the city walls! Open the gates, I'm the ally of yours!

#M12D01S05    [Elhant][Angry][Missions\SOUND\MISSION12\m12_t21.ogg]Dummies!.. I need to find another way in then! Maybe I'll just crash the damned gates?
#M12D02S01    [M12YetiChief][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION12\m12_t08.ogg]Stranger, you helped us, and the law of our tribe tells us to help you in return. Where do you hurry?

#M12D03S03    [M12Enchantress][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION12\m12_t13.ogg]We shall follow you and together we shall repulse the Sols' attack!
#M12D04S01    [M12IceMage2][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION12\m12_t14.ogg]Were not for your help, we would have died! Where are you heading, stranger? Hummm?
#M12D04S02    [Elhant][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION12\m12_t15.ogg]I am hurrying to your capital.
#M12D04S03    [M12IceMage2][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION12\m12_t16.ogg]There's an enemy on your way. Wait. I shall give you several companions to aid your approach.

#M12D05S03    [M12Gremlin][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION12\m12_t07.ogg]Cuh-cuh- Choose the one that is to your luh-luh- liking.
#M12D06S01P1    [M12IceMage1][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION12\m12_t01.ogg]If you seek the Gem, you must gain entrance to the palace.
#M12D06S01P2    [M12IceMage1][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION12\m12_t02.ogg]But make haste, or the Sols will be there before you!
#M12D07S01    [M12DeathMage][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION12\m12_t22.ogg]Look, here's a fool for our experiment!
#M12D07S02    [M12DeathMage][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION12\m12_t23.ogg]Now we'll see whether the golem is truly invulnerable...
#M12D07S03    [Elhant][Angry][Missions\SOUND\MISSION12\m12_t24.ogg]I'm a warrior and not a toy for you wizards! Get out of my way!
#M12D07S04    [M12DeathMage][Normal][Missions\SOUND\MISSION12\m12_t25.ogg]Ha ha! Look at him, he dares to snarl!.. Prepare yourself for death, you insolent fool! Kill him, Golem!
#M12D08S01    [Elhant][Angry][Missions\SOUND\MISSION12\m12_t26.ogg]The palace is under siege. We must finish off the assailants quickly, in order not be afraid of a strike into the back.
